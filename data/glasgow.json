  "aims": "Computer networks have become an integral part of society - we take for granted the ability to transact commerce over the Internet, to store documents online, and that users can avail themselves of a growing set of communication methods, ranging from file sharing to social networking and video conferencing. Moreover, computer networks underpin a lot of recent paradigm-shifting advances in ICT, from Cloud Computing, to Smart Cities and the Internet of Things.To support the seamless provision of all these advanced services, computer networks engage a complex set of interconnected systems and components whose design is governed by principles across the spectrum of Computing Science and Engineering: from hardware and software architecture, to protocols and algorithms, to analysis and modelling.This course will therefore adopt a holistic systems thinking instead of the 'black-box' thinking that often results from treating concepts (such as, e.g., algorithms, OS, networking) in isolation.1.The coursewill look at 'network algorithmics' as an interdisciplinary systems approach to streamlining network stack implementations in routers and end-nodes, and understand the bottlenecks that need to be overcome in order to meet strict performance requirements.2.The coursewillcoverthe importance of high performance in network design and implementation, and understand the need for building networked systems that are on par with ever increasing physical link capacities (you can buy more bandwidth, but cannot buy less delay). In doing so, ways to measure network performancewill be explored, and also approaches to evaluating and analysing the performance of networked systems. Students will therefore be able to generalise and reason about the capabilities and limitations of different processing and service models.3.In addition, the coursewill look at algorithms and technologies for efficient and fair resource usage,and students willunderstand the importance of end-to-end protocol design and traffic engineering.For example, studentswill understand why, in networks, packet loss is not an isolated incident 'when things go wrong' but the norm: a mechanism based on which the appropriate feedback loopscan be createdto ensure that the underlying resources are used fully and shared equally.4.The course will alsolook at recent technological and research advances in emergingcomputer networking technologies and protocols. For example, Data Centre / Cloud networking for achievingfull bi-section bandwidth; Software-Defined Networking (SDN) as a transformative paradigm aiming to logically centralise the network control plane; Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) as an approach to embed add-on services on top of connectivity in network infrastructures;Resilient networked systems.By the end of this course, students will have a deep understanding of the design and implementation principles for building high-performance inter-connected systems, as well as specialist knowledge in advances in computer networking technology. This course will be particularly suitable for students who aspire to successful careers either in systems research, or in diverse industry sectors ranging from global (e.g., Google, Facebook, Amazon) to local (e.g., the banking sector) infrastructure operators, to equipment vendors (e.g., Cisco, Huawei, Ericson) and Internet Service Providers (e.g., BT).",

The desktop personal computer has become largely irrelevant, and heterogeneous, multicore, mobile, and real-time systems - smart mobile phones, netbooks, and laptops - are now ubiquitous. Yet, despite this shift, these systems are still programmed in C, and the majority run some variant of the Unix operating system.The course aims to explore the features of modern programming languages and operating systems that can ease the challenges of systems programming, considering type systems and run-time support. It will review the research literature on systems programming and operating system interfaces, discuss the limitations of deployed systems, and consider how systems programming might evolve to address the challenges of supporting modern computingsystems.  Particular emphasis will be placed on system correctness and secure programming, to ensure the resulting systems are safe to use in an adversarial environment.",

  "aims": "This course aims to introduce students to language modelling, representations of documents, natural language processing, information theory, network models and in general the use of stochastic thinking (including building on the probability theory learned during the IDSS/Data Fundamentals course). This is illustrated through a number of supervised and unsupervised text processing and analytics approaches as well as their applications such as information extraction, question answering, summarization, and dialogue systems.  The course is designed to be applied in nature, using text analytics as an example, and introducing students to various toolkits for document processing.",
